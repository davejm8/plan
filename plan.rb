# My plan moving forward:

# Here is a list of declarations stating how I will execute my plan.

# I will set alarms for 30 minutes prior to each check in to give ample time to reply.

# I will ensure my calendar stays up to date.

# I will ensure those breaks also include time to reflect.

# I will grocery shop on saturdays and meal prep on sundays.

# I will socialize with memebers of my class.
